## Overview

MerchantCore Admin is a React + TypeScript web app that manages stores, catalog, and operations in a multi-tenant setup.

- Tech Stack:
  - React + TypeScript + Vite
  - Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
  - TanStack React Query
  - Zustand (persist middleware) for client state
  - React Router DOM
  - Axios with token refresh interceptor

## Core Features

1. Tenant (store) management and switching
2. Catalog and category management
3. Inventory management
4. Promotions and reports

## Architecture

The UI uses protected routes, local state for auth and current store, and React Query for server state with Axios interceptors.

```
User
  │
  ▼
React Router ──► ProtectedRoute ──► ProtectedLayout
UI (shadcn) ──► Zustand Stores ──► React Query ──► Axios Interceptor ──► MerchantCore API
```

### Access Control

- `ProtectedRoute` checks `isAuthenticated` via `useAuthStore` and redirects unauthenticated users.
- `ProtectedLayout` provides shared navigation, breadcrumbs, and sidebar shell.

### State Management

- `useAuthStore` and `useStoreStore` manage user tokens, stores list, and current store.
- Persistence via `zustand/middleware` stores critical slices in local storage.

## Project Structure

```
/src
  /components         App shell and UI primitives
  /features
    /auth             Authentication flows, store, service
    /catalog          Product APIs, hooks, UI
    /category         Tree, hooks, schema, service
    /inventory        API, hooks, utils
    /stores           API, hooks, store, UI
  /interceptors       Axios interceptor
  /pages              Route pages (Dashboard, Catalog, Inventory, etc.)
  /shared             Shared types
  App.tsx, main.tsx
```

## Reporting

- Reports and promotions pages use shared layout and can integrate filters.
- React Query provides caching and pagination patterns for list views.

## UI/UX Notes

- Tailwind-driven design with shadcn components ensures accessibility and consistency.
- Sidebar and breadcrumb system provides clear navigation across features.

## Configuration

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points to the MerchantCore API.
- Tokens are stored in local storage, with optional refresh handling.

## Project Overview

MerchantCore Admin is a **centralized admin dashboard** integrated with the MerchantCore API. It serves as a unified interface for managing multiple online stores efficiently.

- **Multi-Store Management**: One admin dashboard can manage multiple online stores simultaneously.
- **Decoupled Frontstore**: Each store can have a different frontstore implementation while being managed from the same admin panel.
- **Seamless Switching**: Admins can easily switch between different stores directly from the dashboard.
- **Centralized Data Routing**: All data operations are routed through the MerchantCore API, ensuring consistency and security.

## Core Concept: Store-Based Context

MerchantCore Admin operates using a **store context** model, which ensures that administrative actions are correctly scoped.

- **Store Selection**: The admin selects a specific store (shop) to manage.
- **Scoped Actions**: All subsequent actions—managing products, orders, content, and settings—are automatically scoped to the selected store.
- **No Direct Database Access**: The dashboard does not interact with the database directly.
- **Schema Resolution**: The MerchantCore API handles schema resolution behind the scenes based on the selected store context.

**Conceptual Flow:**

Admin UI → MerchantCore API → Schema-based data access

## Features by Store

For each selected store, the admin dashboard provides comprehensive management capabilities:

- **Products and Categories**: Manage inventory, product details, and categorization.
- **Orders and Customers**: Track orders, process fulfillments, and manage customer data.
- **Store Content**: Update banners, pages, and promotional content.
- **Settings**: Configure store-specific settings and preferences.

**Key Distinction:**

- **Data Isolation**: Data is strictly isolated between stores to prevent overlap.
- **Consistent UI**: The user interface remains consistent across all stores, providing a familiar experience regardless of the store being managed.

## Integration with MerchantCore API

MerchantCore Admin is built to integrate seamlessly with the MerchantCore API:

- **Shared API Contract**: Uses a standardized API contract for communication.
- **Context Awareness**: Passes store identifiers (shop code or store ID) with requests.
- **API-Level Resolution**: Relies on the API to resolve the correct database schema and data source.
- **Logic Separation**: No store-specific business logic resides inside the dashboard; it purely acts as a management interface.

## Benefits

- **Centralized Control**: Manage an entire portfolio of stores from a single location.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifies operations by unifying management tools.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new stores without deploying new admin instances.
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintains a clean separation between the admin UI and backend logic.

## Use Cases

- **E-commerce SaaS Platforms**: Offering store management to multiple merchants.
- **Multi-Brand Businesses**: Operating distinct brands under one umbrella.
- **Agencies**: Managing multiple client stores from a single account.

## Summary

MerchantCore Admin provides a powerful, single admin dashboard solution for managing multiple frontstores. By leveraging the unified backend of the MerchantCore API, it delivers a seamless, store-based management experience that is both scalable and efficient.
